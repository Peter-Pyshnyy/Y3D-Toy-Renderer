A personal OpenGL renderer built for learning and experimenting with modern graphics techniques, rendering algorithms, and engine architecture concepts.
The goal of this project is to explore rendering pipelines, shader systems, and performance optimizations in a hands-on way.

**Building Notes**

- All dependencies are either included in the project or fetched using CMake
- On some machines running Visual Studio, the project may fail to configure or build properly unless the CMake generator is explicitly set to "Visual Studio 17 2022 Win64"
- Expect the first compilation to take longer

_work in progress..._
